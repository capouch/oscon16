White County Historical Society was the vision of William H. Hamelle as he presented the ideas at the White County Old Settlers meeting, August 26, 1911.  A committee was appointed to organize said Society.  Members of this committee were J.B. VanBuskirk, William H. Hamelle, Bernard G. Smith, James P. Simons and Will S. Bushnell.  These gentlemen met at the office of Spencer & Hamelle on the evening of September 1, 1911 and effected the organization of the White County Historical Society.  The first annual meeting was held in Library Hall , Monticello IN, April 19, 1912 .

On October 28, 1958, a meeting was "arranged and planned for the purpose of reactioning White County Historical Society on a permanent basis".  More than sixty persons signed on as Charter Members of the White County Historical Society.

In 1971, after storing the museum collections at the Monticello Library for a number of years, discussion turned to the possibility of a County Museum.  Finally, in 1976, with gratitude to the White County Commissioners, a room was set-aside in the new County Building for a museum on the second floor.

With museum acquisitions growing, the White County Historical Society was in need of a larger space.  That space was provided with the move of the Monticello Public Library to a new building on West Broadway in 1992, leaving the Carnegie Building, on Bluff Street, known as the former Monticello Library, vacant.  After minor renovations, the Carnegie Building is the present and proud home of the White County Historical Society.
